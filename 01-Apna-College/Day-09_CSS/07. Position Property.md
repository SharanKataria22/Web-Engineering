## üìç CSS `position` Property

The `position` property in CSS defines **how an element is positioned** in the document. It affects the layout behavior and how the element is placed relative to the normal flow or other elements.

---

### üîπ `static` (Default)

- Elements follow the normal document flow.
- Cannot be offset using `top`, `right`, `bottom`, or `left`.

```css
.box {
  position: static;
}
```

---

### üîπ `relative`

- The element remains in the normal flow, but can be **moved** using `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`.
- Other elements are **not affected** by this movement.

```css
.box {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px; /* Moves 20px down */
}
```

---

### üîπ `absolute`

- Element is removed from the normal document flow.
- Positioned **relative to the nearest positioned ancestor** (anything except `static`), or the `<html>` if none found.

```css
.box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 10px;
  left: 30px;
}
```

---

### üîπ `fixed`

- The element is **positioned relative to the viewport**.
- It stays in place when the page scrolls.

```css
.navbar {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  width: 100%;
}
```

## üß† Summary Table

| Value     | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| `static`  | Default, normal flow |
| `relative`| Moves element slightly, retains space |
| `absolute`| Removed from flow, placed relative to ancestor |
| `fixed`   | Stays fixed on screen, even when scrolling |

üí° **Tip:** Use `z-index` with `positioned` elements (other than `static`) to control layering.

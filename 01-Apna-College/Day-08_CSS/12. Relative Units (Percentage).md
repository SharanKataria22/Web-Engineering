# 📏 Relative Unit: `percentage (%)` in CSS

In CSS, the `%` (percentage) unit is a **relative unit**.  
It sizes an element **relative to its parent element’s size**.

---

## 🔹 How It Works:

- `width: 50%;` means the element will take up **50% of its parent's width**.
- `height: 100%;` makes the element’s height match **100% of the parent's height** (if the parent's height is defined).
- Can also be used with `margin`, `padding`, `font-size`, etc.

---

### 🧪 Example:

```css
.container {
  width: 100%;
}

.child {
  width: 50%;   /* Takes up half the width of .container */
  padding: 10%;
}
```
💡 Tip: % is great for creating responsive designs that adjust to different screen sizes.

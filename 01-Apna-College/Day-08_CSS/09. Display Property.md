# ðŸ§± Display Property in CSS

The `display` property in CSS determines how an element is visually laid out on the page.

---

## ðŸ”¹ `display: block;`

- Element starts on a **new line**.
- Takes up the **full width** of its parent by default.
- You can set `width`, `height`, `margin`, and `padding`.

**Example elements:** `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`

---

## ðŸ”¸ `display: inline;`

- Element does **not start on a new line**.
- Takes up **only as much width** as its content needs.
- Cannot set `width` and `height` directly.
- Only horizontal `margin` and `padding` are applied.

**Example elements:** `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`

> ðŸ§  Tip: Use these values to control how elements behave in the layout â€” whether they should break to a new line (`block`) or stay inline with text (`inline`).

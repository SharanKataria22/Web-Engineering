# 🔗 HTML Anchor Tag & Links

---

## 📌 What is the Anchor (`<a>`) Tag?

The HTML `<a>` tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link one page to another or to a section within the same page.

Syntax:
```html
<a href="URL">Link Text</a>
```
Point: 🧲 `href` attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.
Link Text is the clickable text users see.

Example:
```html
<a href="https://www.google.com">Visit Google</a>
```
## 🔹 Absolute vs. Relative Links

Understanding the difference between absolute and relative links is crucial for web development:

### 🌐 Absolute Link
✅ Points to an external website or resource.

✅ Always includes the full URL (with protocol: http:// or https://)

Example:
```html
<a href="https://www.github.com">Go to GitHub (Absolute Link)</a>
```

### 📁 Relative Link

✅ Points to a file or page within your own website/project folder.

✅ Uses the relative path from the current file’s location.

Example:
```html
<a href="about.html">Go to About Page (Relative Link)</a>
```

Or if linking to a file in a subfolder:

```html
<a href="folder/contact.html">Go to Contact Page (Relative Link)</a>
```
🔎 When to Use What?
Use `absolute` links when linking to other websites.

Use `relative` links when linking between pages of your own website — it makes your project portable (you can move your site to a different domain without changing links).

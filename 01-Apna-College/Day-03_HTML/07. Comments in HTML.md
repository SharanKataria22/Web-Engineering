## ðŸ“Œ What are Comments in HTML?

**Comments** are notes written in the HTML code that the browser completely ignores when rendering the page. Theyâ€™re used to:
- Explain code to yourself or others
- Temporarily disable parts of code
- Organize your HTML files with section notes

## ðŸ”– Syntax of HTML Comments

Comments start with `<!--` and end with `-->`.

```html
<!-- This is a single-line comment -->

<!-- 
  This is a 
  multi-line comment.
-->
Everything between <!-- and --> is considered a comment and wonâ€™t appear on the webpage.

## âœ… Where to Use Comments?
To describe the purpose of a section:

```html
<!-- Header section starts here -->
<header>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
</header>
To temporarily remove a piece of code:
```

```html
<!-- <p>This paragraph is temporarily disabled.</p> -->
To leave notes or reminders for yourself or collaborators:
```

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes
âœ… Comments are only visible in the HTML source code â€” not on the rendered page.
âœ… Donâ€™t put sensitive information in comments, as anyone can view your HTML source.
âœ… Comments cannot be nested â€” you canâ€™t start a new comment inside an existing comment.

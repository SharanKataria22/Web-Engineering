# 🖼️ HTML Image Element:
## Absolute & Relative Paths

---

## 📌 What is the `<img>` Element?

The HTML `<img>` tag is used to **embed images** in a web page.

Syntax:
```html
<img src="path-to-image" alt="Description of image">
```
The `src` attribute specifies the path to your image, and it can be either an absolute path or a relative path.

## 🌐 Absolute Path
An absolute path points directly to an image on the internet (or uses the full file path on your system, but online we use URLs).

✅ It includes the complete URL with http:// or https://.

Example:

```html
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Red_sunset.jpg" alt="A beautiful sunset">
This image will always load from the specified URL, no matter where your HTML file is hosted.
```

## 📁 Relative Path
A relative path points to an image stored within your project/repo.
It’s relative to the location of your HTML file.

Example:

```markdown

project-folder/
├── index.html
└── images/
    └── kitten.jpg
Then in index.html:
```

```html
<img src="images/kitten.jpg" alt="Cute Kitten">
This image will load from the local images folder, relative to index.html.
```

### ✅ When to Use Which?
→ Absolute path:

Best when loading images from external sources.

Useful for images hosted on CDNs or third-party sites.

Always accessible as long as the external server is online.

→ Relative path:

Best when images are part of your own website/project.

Makes your project portable — you can move your site without breaking links.

Keeps resources self-contained.

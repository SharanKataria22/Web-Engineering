# ðŸ”¤ Case Sensitivity in HTML

---

## ðŸ“Œ Is HTML Case Sensitive?

**No, HTML is not case-sensitive!**  
HTML tags and attribute names can be written in **uppercase**, **lowercase**, or **mixed case**, and the browser will treat them the same.

For example:
```html
<H1>This works</H1>
<h1>This also works</h1>
```

## ðŸ”Ž Why HTML is Case-Insensitive?

HTML was designed to be simple and forgiving.
Its case-insensitivity helps developers write tags in any style they prefer.

Example:
```html
<BODY>
  <H1>Hello World</H1>
</BODY>

## 🔹 `justify-content` in CSS Flexbox

The `justify-content` property is used to **align flex items along the main axis** of the flex container.

It controls how the **extra space** is distributed **between or around items** when they don’t use all the available space on the main axis.

---

### 🧭 Works With:
- The **main axis**, which is defined by the `flex-direction` property.
- Use `justify-content` to control horizontal alignment if `flex-direction: row`, or vertical alignment if `flex-direction: column`.

### ✅ Common Values:

| Value               | Description                                               |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `flex-start`        | Items are packed at the start of the main axis (default) |
| `flex-end`          | Items are packed at the end of the main axis             |
| `center`            | Items are centered along the main axis                   |
| `space-between`     | Items are evenly distributed — first item at start, last at end |
| `space-around`      | Items are evenly distributed with **equal space around** |
| `space-evenly`      | Items are distributed with **equal space between all items** |

### 🔍 Example

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

```html
<div class="container">
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2</div>
  <div>Item 3</div>
</div>
```

In this case:
- All items will be **centered** horizontally (main axis is horizontal by default).

💡 **Tip:** Always remember:  
📦 `justify-content` → Aligns items **on the main axis**  
📏 Depends on the value of `flex-direction`

# 🔹 `display: flex` in CSS

The `display: flex` property is used to **activate Flexbox layout** on a container. It makes all **direct child elements** of the container behave as **flex items**, giving you powerful layout control.

## 🧱 Syntax

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}
```

### ⚙️ What Happens When You Use `display: flex`?

✅ All direct children become flex items  
✅ Items are arranged **in a row by default**  
✅ You gain access to Flexbox properties like:
- `flex-direction`
- `justify-content`
- `align-items`
- `gap`
- and more...

---

### 📌 Example

```html
<div class="flex-container">
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2</div>
  <div>Item 3</div>
</div>
```

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
}
```

This arranges the items **side by side** in a row.

💡 **Tip:** Use `display: flex` when you want to:
- Create responsive layouts
- Align items horizontally or vertically
- Distribute space between items easily

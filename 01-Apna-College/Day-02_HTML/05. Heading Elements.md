# 🏷️ Heading Elements in HTML

HTML provides six levels of headings, from `<h1>` (largest/most important) to `<h6>` (smallest/least important). Headings are used to define the structure of content and improve readability.

Example:
```html
<h1>This is an H1 Heading</h1>
<h2>This is an H2 Heading</h2>
<h3>This is an H3 Heading</h3>
<h4>This is an H4 Heading</h4>
<h5>This is an H5 Heading</h5>
<h6>This is an H6 Heading</h6>

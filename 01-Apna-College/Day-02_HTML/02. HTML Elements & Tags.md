## 📌 What is an HTML Element?

An **HTML element** is a complete piece of content defined by a start tag, content, and an end tag.

Example:
```html
<h1>This is a Heading</h1>

<h1> → Opening tag
This is a Heading. → Content
</h1> → Closing tag

Together, these three parts make one HTML element.

```

## 📌 What is an HTML Tag?

A tag is a keyword inside angle brackets < > used to define the start or end of an HTML element.
Tags are the building blocks of HTML.

Most tags come in pairs: opening tag <tag> and closing tag </tag>.

Example
```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<p> → opening tag
</p> → closing tag

Combined with content, they form the element.

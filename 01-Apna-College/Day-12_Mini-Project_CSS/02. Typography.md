## 🔹 Common Font Families

### 🖋️ Serif Fonts
- Have small decorative strokes at the ends.  
- Look **formal, traditional, professional**.  
- Examples:  
```css
font-family: "Times New Roman", Georgia, serif;
```

### 🔤 Sans-Serif Fonts
- Clean, no decorative strokes.
- Look modern, minimal, clear.
- Examples:
```css
font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
```

### 🖊️ Script Fonts
- Imitate handwriting.
- Look elegant, personal, creative.
- Examples:
```css
font-family: "Brush Script MT", cursive;
```

### 🎨 Display / Decorative Fonts

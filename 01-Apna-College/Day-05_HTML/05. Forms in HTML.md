# 📝 HTML `<form>` Tag and `action` Attribute

---

## 📌 What is `<form>` in HTML?

The `<form>` tag in HTML is used to create a **form section** on a webpage where users can **submit data**.

It acts as a **container** that holds input elements like text boxes, checkboxes, buttons, etc.  
But the form itself controls **how** and **where** the data is sent.

## ⚙️ Syntax

```html
<form action="URL">
  <!-- form elements go here -->
</form>
```

## 🔗 action Attribute
- The action attribute defines the destination URL where the form data will be sent after submission.
- If action="" is empty, the form submits to the same page.
- If you provide a URL, the data is sent to that specific server/page for processing.

📌 Example:
```html
<form action="submit.php">
  <!-- user inputs will be submitted to submit.php -->
</form>
```

### 💡 Notes:
- The URL in action can be relative (e.g., "submit.php") or absolute (e.g., "https://example.com/submit").
- It is commonly used in combination with the method attribute (GET or POST) to define how the data is sent.

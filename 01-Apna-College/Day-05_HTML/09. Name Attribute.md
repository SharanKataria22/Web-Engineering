# 🏷️ `name` Attribute in HTML `<input>` Tag

## 📌 What is the `name` Attribute?

The `name` attribute in an `<input>` tag is used to **identify the form data** after submission.

When a user submits a form, each input's `name` becomes the **key**, and the entered value becomes the **value** in the data sent to the server.

---

## 🧠 Why Is It Important?

- Without `name`, **input data won’t be sent** to the server.
- It acts like a **variable name** for each input field.

### ✍ Example:

```html
<form action="submit.php" method="post">
  <label for="username">Username:</label>
  <input type="text" id="username" name="username">

  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email">

  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```
## 📤 What Gets Sent to Server?
```ini
username=sharan&email=sharan@example.com
```
Here:
username and email are names of fields
Their entered values are sent along with them

### 💡 Tip:
- Attribute	Description
- name	Key for input value during submit
- id	For linking with label or JavaScript

✅ Use both id and name in forms for best practice.

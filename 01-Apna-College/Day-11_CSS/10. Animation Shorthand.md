# 🎬 CSS – Animation (Shorthand)

The **`animation`** shorthand lets you set all animation properties in **one line**.  

---

## 🔹 Syntax

```css
selector {
  animation: name duration timing-function delay iteration-count direction fill-mode play-state;
}
```
👉 Order matters:
animation: animation-name animation-duration animation-timing-function animation-delay animation-iteration-count animation-direction animation-fill-mode animation-play-state;

## 🔹 Example 1: Simple Shorthand
```css
Copy code
@keyframes fade {
  from { opacity: 0; }
  to   { opacity: 1; }
}

.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background: teal;

  animation: fade 2s ease-in-out infinite alternate;
}
```
👉 Box fades in and out forever.

## 🔹 Example 2: With Delay & Fill Mode
```css
Copy code
@keyframes slide {
  from { transform: translateX(0); }
  to   { transform: translateX(200px); }
}

.item {
  width: 80px;
  height: 80px;
  background: tomato;

  animation: slide 3s linear 1s 2 forwards;
}
```
👉 Item slides right, lasts 3s, starts after 1s, repeats 2 times, and keeps final position.

### 📝 Notes
- Shorthand makes code shorter but can be harder to read.
- Always include at least: name duration
- Properties not defined in shorthand fall back to their defaults.

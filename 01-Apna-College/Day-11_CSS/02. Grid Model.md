# 📐 CSS Grid Model

The **CSS Grid Model** is a 2D layout system that allows you to arrange elements into rows and columns easily.  
It divides the container into **grid lines**, **grid cells**, and **grid tracks**.

---

## 🔹 1. Grid Lines
- The **lines** that define the boundaries of grid tracks.
- They can be **vertical** (column lines) or **horizontal** (row lines).
- Grid lines are numbered starting from `1` for each row and column.

---

## 🔹 2. Grid Cell
- The **smallest unit** in the grid layout.
- It is the **intersection** of a single row and a single column.
- A grid cell is like one “box” in the grid.

---

## 🔹 3. Grid Track
- A **row** or **column** in the grid.
- Tracks are the space **between two grid lines**.
- Can be **row tracks** (horizontal) or **column tracks** (vertical).

### 📌 Example CSS Grid Layout
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 100px 100px 100px;
  grid-template-rows: 50px 50px;
}

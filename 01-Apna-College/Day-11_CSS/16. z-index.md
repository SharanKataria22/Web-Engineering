# 🗂️ CSS z-index

The **`z-index`** property controls the **stacking order** of elements (which element appears **in front** or **behind**).

---

## 🔹 Syntax
```css
selector {
  z-index: number;
}
```
### 🔹 Examples
```css
.box1 {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 1; /* behind */
}

.box2 {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 10; /* in front */
}
```
#### 📝 Notes
- Works only on elements with position: relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky.
- Higher value = element appears on top.
- Negative values push elements behind others.
- If two elements have the same z-index, the one that comes later in HTML appears on top.

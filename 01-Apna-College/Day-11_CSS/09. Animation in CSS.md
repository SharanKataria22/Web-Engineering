# 🎬 CSS – Animation

The **`animation`** property in CSS is used to create motion effects by changing styles over time.  
Animations are defined with **@keyframes** and applied to elements.
---

## 🔹 Syntax

```css
selector {
  animation-name: myAnimation;       /* name of the @keyframes */
  animation-duration: 3s;            /* how long animation runs */
  animation-timing-function: ease;   /* speed curve */
  animation-delay: 1s;               /* wait before start */
  animation-iteration-count: 2;      /* number of repeats (or infinite) */
  animation-direction: alternate;    /* normal, reverse, alternate */
  animation-fill-mode: forwards;     /* keep final style after end */
  animation-play-state: running;     /* running or paused */
}
```
### 🔹 Example
```css
@keyframes colorChange {
  from { background: red; }
  to   { background: yellow; }
}

.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background: red;

  animation-name: colorChange;
  animation-duration: 2s;
  animation-timing-function: linear;
  animation-delay: 0s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-direction: alternate;
  animation-fill-mode: forwards;
}
```
👉 This box smoothly changes color between red and yellow forever.

### 📝 Notes
- Writing animations in long form is good for learning and clarity.
- Later you can use the shorthand to keep code short.

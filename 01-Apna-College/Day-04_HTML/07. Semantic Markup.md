# 🧠 What is Semantic Markup in HTML?

---

## 📌 Definition

**Semantic markup** means using HTML elements in a way that clearly defines the **meaning and purpose of the content** on a web page — not just its appearance.

Instead of just saying “this text is bold,” semantic HTML tells the browser, screen readers, and search engines **what the content actually is**, like a heading, navigation, article, or footer.

## 🧩 Why Semantic Markup Matters?

### ✅ 1. **Improves Accessibility**
Screen readers and assistive technologies rely on semantic elements to help users **understand the page structure**.

### ✅ 2. **Better SEO**
Search engines like Google use semantic tags to **understand your content**, which can improve search rankings.

### ✅ 3. **Cleaner Code & Easier Maintenance**
Semantic markup makes your code **more readable and meaningful** for developers.

### ✅ 4. **Enhances Browser Behavior**
Browsers can apply **default styling and structure** based on semantics, improving cross-browser consistency.

## 🧠 Semantic vs Non-Semantic Example

### 🚫 Non-Semantic HTML:
```html
<div id="header">Welcome</div>
<div id="nav">Menu</div>
```

### ✅ Semantic HTML:
```html
<header>Welcome</header>
<nav>Menu</nav>
```
Both may look the same visually — but only the second one actually tells the browser and machines what the content is.

# ðŸ§±Block vs Inline Elements

---

## ðŸ“Œ What are HTML Elements?

In HTML, every element behaves either as a **block-level element** or an **inline-level element** by default.

---

## ðŸ”· Block-Level Elements

Block elements:
- Occupy **full width** of the parent container.
- Always start on a **new line**.
- Can contain **inline** and **other block** elements.

### âœ… Examples:
- `<h1>` to `<h6>` â€” Headings
- `<p>` â€” Paragraph

### ðŸ”— Behavior:
```html
<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a Paragraph.</p>
```
Output:

"Heading" and "Paragraph" appear on separate lines.
They stretch across the entire width available.

## ðŸ”¸ Inline Elements
Inline elements:

- Take up only as much width as necessary.
- Do not start on a new line.
- Can only contain text or other inline elements.

### âœ… Examples:
- `<a>` â€” Anchor (link)

- `<img>` â€” Image

### ðŸ”— Behavior:
```html
<p>This is a <a href="#">link</a> and an <img src="image.jpg" alt="pic"> in a paragraph.</p>
```
Output:

Link and image appear within the line of text, not breaking it.

## üéØ Defined: `px` ‚Äì Pixels

`px` stands for **pixels** ‚Äì a pixel is a tiny dot on the screen.

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 24px;
}
```

### ‚úÖNote
- 1 pixel = 1 dot on the screen (in most cases). It's an absolute unit and doesn't change based on screen size or resolution (though zoom can affect it).

- Best for: precise spacing and fixed-size elements.

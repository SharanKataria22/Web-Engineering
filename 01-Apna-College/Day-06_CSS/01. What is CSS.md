# 🎨 Introduction to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

## 📌 What is CSS?

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is the language used to **style and visually enhance** web pages.

Where **HTML builds the structure** of a webpage, **CSS brings it to life** by adding:

- 🎨 Colors  
- 🖋 Fonts  
- 📐 Layout  
- 📱 Responsiveness  
- ✨ Animations

Without CSS, all websites would look the same — **plain, dull, and hard to navigate.**  
With CSS, websites become **beautiful**, **readable**, and **user-friendly**.

|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|

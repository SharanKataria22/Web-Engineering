# 🧱 Basic format in CSS.

## 📌 What is the structure of a CSS rule?

In CSS, styles are written using **rules** that have 3 main parts:

```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```
## ✍️ Example:
```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
```
## 🔍 Explanation

| Part     | Description                                                                 |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `h1`     | **Selector** – Tells the browser which HTML element to style (`<h1>` in this case) |
| `color`  | **Property** – The feature you want to change (like text color, font size, etc.) |
| `blue`   | **Value** – The setting you want to apply to the property                   |
| `{ }`    | **Curly Braces** – Hold all the styles for the selected element             |
| `;`      | **Semicolon** – Ends each property-value pair                               |

### ✅ Output:
- This rule will make all <h1> headings:
- Blue in color
- Font size of 30 pixels

### 🧠 Reminder:
- Always close each line with a semicolon ;
- You can add multiple properties inside one selector
- CSS is case-insensitive, but lowercase is recommended for consistency

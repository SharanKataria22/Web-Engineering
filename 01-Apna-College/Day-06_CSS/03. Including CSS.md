# 🎯 How to Include CSS in HTML

---

CSS can be added to HTML documents in **three main ways**:

---

## 1️⃣ Inline CSS

CSS is written **inside the HTML element** using the `style` attribute.

```html
<h1 style="color: red;">This is a red heading</h1>
```
- 🔹 Best for quick, one-time styles
- 🔸 ❌ Not recommended for large or reusable designs

---

## 2️⃣ Internal CSS
CSS is written inside a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section of the HTML file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: green;
      font-size: 18px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>This is a green paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

- 🔹 Good for small projects or single-page sites
- 🔸 Styles are only for that HTML file

---

## 3️⃣ External CSS
CSS is written in a separate .css file and linked to HTML using the <link> tag.

```html
<!-- HTML file -->
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
```
```css
/* style.css file */
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}
```
- 🔹 ✅ Recommended method for all professional and larger projects
- 🔸 Keeps structure (HTML) and styling (CSS) separate

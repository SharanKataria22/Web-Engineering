## ðŸ†” CSS ID Selector

The **ID Selector** is used to style a **single unique element** on a webpage.  
It selects an element using its `id` attribute and starts with a **`#` symbol** in CSS.

---

### ðŸ§© Example:

#### HTML:
```html
<h1 id="main-heading">Welcome</h1>
```
#### CSS:
```css
#main-heading {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 32px;
}
```
This will style only the element with id="main-heading" â€” even if there are multiple <h1> tags on the page.

### âœ… Key Points:
- IDs must be unique on a page (only used once).
- Use # followed by the id name.
- Great for targeting a specific section, button, or container.

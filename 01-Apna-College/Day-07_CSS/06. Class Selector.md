## ðŸ§¾ Class Selector

The **Class Selector** is used to style **one or more elements** that share the same class name.  
It starts with a **`.` (dot)** in CSS and targets elements with the `class` attribute in HTML.

---

### ðŸ§© Example:

#### HTML:
```html
<p class="highlight">This is important.</p>
<p class="highlight">This is also important.</p>
```
#### CSS:
```css
.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```
This will style both <p> elements that have the class highlight.

### âœ… Key Points:
- Use . followed by the class name (e.g., .box, .button).
- Unlike IDs, classes can be reused on multiple elements.
- Useful for styling groups of elements with the same design.

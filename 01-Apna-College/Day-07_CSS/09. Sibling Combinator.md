## ü§ù CSS Sibling Combinators

Sibling combinators in CSS allow you to style elements based on their position **next to each other** in the HTML structure.

There are **two types** of sibling combinators:

---

### **Adjacent Sibling Selector (`+`)**
- Selects the **immediately next** element that shares the same parent.

#### ‚úÖ Example:
#### HTML
```html
<h2>Heading</h2>
<p>This paragraph comes right after h2.</p>
<p>This paragraph is not selected.</p>
```
#### CSS
```css
h2 + p {
  color: blue;
}
This will only style the first paragraph immediately after the `<h2>`.
```

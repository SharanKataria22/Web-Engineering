# ⚠️ `!important` in CSS

The **`!important`** rule in CSS is used to **override all other styles**, including inline styles and higher specificity selectors.

When a CSS property is marked with `!important`, it becomes the **highest priority** in the cascade.

---

## ✅ Syntax:
```css
selector {
  property: value !important;
}
```
## ✅ Example:
```css
p {
  color: blue !important;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```
Result: The paragraph will be blue, because the first rule has !important even though the second rule comes later.

### ✅ Key Points:
- !important overrides:
- Inline styles
- ID selectors
- Class selectors
- Should be used only when necessary, because it can make CSS harder to maintain.
- If two rules have !important, then specificity and source order decide.

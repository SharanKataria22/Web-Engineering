## ðŸ‘¶ CSS Child Combinator (`>`)

The **Child Combinator** (`>`) in CSS selects elements that are **direct children** of a specified parent element.

It does **NOT** select deeper nested elements â€” only the immediate child.

---

### ðŸ§© Syntax:
```css
parent > child {
  property: value;
}
```
### âœ… Example:
#### HTML:
```html
<div>
  <p>This is a direct child paragraph.</p>
  <span>
    <p>This is nested inside a span (not a direct child of div).</p>
  </span>
</div>
```
#### CSS:
```css
div > p {
  color: red;
}
```
This will only style the first paragraph because it is a direct child of <div>.
The second paragraph will not be affected since it is nested inside a <span>.

### âœ… Key Points:
- targets only immediate child elements, not deeper levels.
- Useful for precise styling inside structured layouts.
- Prevents unwanted styles on deeply nested elements.

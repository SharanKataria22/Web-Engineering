## ðŸŽ­ CSS Pseudo-classes

**Pseudo-classes** define a special state of an element.  
They are written with a colon `:` before the pseudo-class name.

Commonly used pseudo-classes include `:hover`, `:active`, `:checked`, and `:nth-of-type()`.

### âœ… 1. `:hover`
- Applies styles when the user **places the mouse pointer over an element**.

#### Example:
```css
button:hover {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}
```
### âœ… 2. :active
- Applies styles when the element is being clicked (active state).

#### Example:
```css
button:active {
  background-color: darkblue;
}
```
### âœ… 3. :checked
- Targets checked form elements, like checkboxes or radio buttons.

#### Example:
```css
input[type="checkbox"]:checked {
  background-color: green;
}
```
### âœ… 4. :nth-of-type(n)
- Selects elements based on their position among siblings of the same type.

#### Example:
```css
p:nth-of-type(2) {
  color: red;
}
```
This will style the second `<p>` element in its parent.

### âœ… Key Points:
- Pseudo-classes allow dynamic styling without JavaScript.
- They respond to user interaction or element state.
- Common use cases: hover effects, button states, styling forms, alternating table rows, etc.

## ðŸ”— CSS Descendant Selector

The **Descendant Selector** is used to select elements that are **inside another element** (nested within).  
It is written by separating two selectors with a **space**.

---

### ðŸ§© Syntax:
```css
parent child {
  property: value;
}
```
### âœ… Example:
#### HTML:
```html
<div>
  <p>This paragraph is inside a div.</p>
</div>
<p>This paragraph is outside the div.</p>
```
#### CSS:
```css
div p {
  color: red;
}
```
This will only make the paragraph inside the <div> red. The paragraph outside the <div> will not be affected.

### âœ… Key Points:
- Targets child elements that are inside a specific parent.
- Very useful for applying styles only to elements inside a section or container.
- Helps keep styles organized and specific.

# 🏷️ What Are Selectors in CSS?

**Selectors** in CSS are used to **target HTML elements** that you want to style.

They tell the browser:  
➡️ “Which elements should this CSS rule apply to?”

---

### 🧩 Example:
```css
p {
  color: blue;
}
```

## ✳️ Universal Selector

The **universal selector (`*`)** in CSS is used to select **all elements** on a webpage.

It applies the defined style rules to **every HTML element**, unless overridden by more specific selectors.

---

### 🔹 Syntax:
```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

### 💡 Why Use It?
- To apply a default style to all elements.
- Often used to reset margin and padding to avoid browser inconsistencies.
- Useful for creating a consistent base before adding custom styles.

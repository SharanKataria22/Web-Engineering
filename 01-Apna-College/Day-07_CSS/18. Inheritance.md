# ðŸŒ± Inheritance in CSS

**Inheritance** in CSS means that some CSS properties applied to a parent element are **passed down to its child elements**.

---

## âœ… How It Works:
- If you apply a style to a **parent element**, certain properties (like text color and font) automatically apply to its **child elements**.
- Not all properties are inherited. For example:
  - **Inherited properties:** `color`, `font-family`, `line-height`
  - **Not inherited by default:** `margin`, `padding`, `border`

---

### ðŸ§© Example:
#### HTML:
```html
<div>
  <p>This text will inherit the color from the div.</p>
</div>
```
#### CSS:
```css
div {
  color: blue;
}
```
Result: The paragraph text will also be blue because color is an inherited property.

### âœ… Key Points:
- Inheritance makes styling easier by reducing repetitive code.
- You can control inheritance using:
- inherit â†’ Forces inheritance.
- initial â†’ Resets to default.
- unset â†’ Resets based on inheritance rules.

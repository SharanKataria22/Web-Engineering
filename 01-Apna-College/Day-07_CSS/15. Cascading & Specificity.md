# ðŸŒŠ Cascading & Specificity in CSS

CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**, and the word **cascading** refers to the order in which styles are applied when there are multiple rules targeting the same element.

---

## âœ… Cascading in CSS
- When two or more CSS rules apply to the same element, **CSS decides which rule wins** based on:
  1. **Importance** (Inline styles or `!important`)
  2. **Specificity** (How specific the selector is)
  3. **Source order** (The last rule in the CSS file overrides earlier ones)

---

## âœ… Specificity in CSS
**Specificity** is the ranking system that determines which CSS rule is applied when there is a conflict.

- **Inline styles** â†’ Highest priority  
- **ID selector (`#id`)** â†’ High  
- **Class selector (`.class`)** â†’ Medium  
- **Element selector (`p`, `div`)** â†’ Low

### ðŸ§© Specificity Order:
| Selector Type    | Points |
|------------------|--------|
| Inline styles    | 1000   |
| ID (`#id`)       | 100    |
| Class (`.class`), Attribute, Pseudo-class | 10 |
| Element (`p`, `h1`), Pseudo-element | 1 |

---

### âœ… Example:
#### HTML
```html
<p id="text" class="highlight">Hello CSS</p>
```
#### CSS
```css
p { color: blue; }           /* Element selector (1 point) */
.highlight { color: green; } /* Class selector (10 points) */
#text { color: red; }        /* ID selector (100 points) */
```
Result: The text will be red, because ID has the highest specificity.

### âœ… Key Points:
- Cascading = order of applying CSS rules.
- Specificity = which rule wins when multiple rules target the same element.
- If specificity is the same, the last rule in the CSS file wins.
